Versioning policy
=================

New version releases for Referentielijsten API are done every two months, at the start of the month.
Major releases occur every two years.

Each major version is supported until 24 months after the release of the next major version.
The most recent major version is supported without a fixed end date until a new major version is released.
Each minor version within a supported major version is supported until 6 months after its release.

Only the latest version (the numbered version, not the technical latest-tag)
is actively maintained and under active development. Older versions only receive patches

.. note::

   Because 0.x versions are generally not supported, this support policy will apply once version 1.0 is released.
